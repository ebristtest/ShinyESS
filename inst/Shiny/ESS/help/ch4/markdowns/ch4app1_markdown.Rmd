## Examples: SRS Means and Totals

#### Example 4.2 from page 85 of SMOG

**Background:**

Refer to Example 4.1 on page 79 and suppose that a random sample of n = 200 accounts is selected from the total of N = 1000. The sample mean of the accounts is found to be $\bar y$ = \$94.22, and the sample variance is $s^2$ = 445.21. Estimate $\mu$, the average due for all 1000 hospital accounts, and place a bound on the error of estimation.

**Solution**

Select the *User Values* data source. Fill in the provided information. When you're done, the input box should look like this:

```{r input, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A caption"}
knitr::include_graphics("help/ch4/markdowns/inputs.png")
```

In the output box, the estimate is $\hat \mu$ = \$94.22 with a margin of error of \$2.67. This margin of error is also the bound on the error of estimation since the multiplier used was 2 (see the output options box). 

```{r output, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A caption"}
knitr::include_graphics("help/ch4/markdowns/output.png")
```
